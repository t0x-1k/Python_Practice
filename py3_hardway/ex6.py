## Define the number of types of people
types_of_people = 10

## Create a string with the number of types of people
x = f"There are {types_of_people} types of people"

## Define the binary and do not strings
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"

## Create a string with the binary and do not strings
y = f"Those who know {binary} and those who {do_not}"

## Print the strings
print(x)
print(y)

## Create a string with the previous strings
print(f"I said: {x}")
print(f"I also said: '{y}'")

## Define a boolean variable for the joke evaluation
hilarious = False
#
## Create a string with the joke evaluation...the empty curly braces are placeholders for the .format() method
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! {}"

## Print the joke evaluation string
print(joke_evaluation.format(hilarious))

## Define the left and right sides of the string
w = "This is the left side of..."
e = "a string with a right side."

## Concatenate the left and right sides and print the result
print(w + e)


#In this code, we define the number of types of people, create a string with the number of types of people, define the binary and do not strings, create a string with the binary and do not strings, print the strings, create a string with the previous strings
