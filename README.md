# Python_Practice

Just sharing my scripts of how I am learning about the uses of python and how to implement it in my daily workflow.
The py3_hardway come from a book I purchased and use it to further my grasp of the language and its uses.
The practice_code folder is some of the things I have been writing on my own.
The rest are scripts I write on the fly when doing CTF challenges or engagements.

Also, just another way for me to connect to the Python community.
I believe the more interactive you are with said community, the more insight and knowledge you gain.
